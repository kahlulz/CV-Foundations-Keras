## Introduction

Computer vision is a rapidly growing field that deals with enabling machines to interpret and understand the visual world. This repository aims to provide practical implementations of computer vision tasks using Keras, a popular deep learning framework.

Keras provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface to build complex neural network architectures. In this repository, you will find projects that showcase the power and flexibility of Keras in solving computer vision problems.

## Projects

1. **Project 1: CIFAR10 Image Classification with ANN using Keras Sequential**
   - Description: This project demonstrates image classification using a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented with Keras Sequential API. It uses a dataset of labeled images to train the model and make predictions on unseen data.

2. **Project 2: Converting Keras Sequential to Keras Functional (CIFAR10 Image Classification)**
   - Description: This project demonstrates the conversion of a Keras Sequential model to a Keras Functional model. The Keras Functional API allows more flexibility in designing complex neural network architectures; hence it may be used for NNs that require more network complexity.

3. **Project 3: Image Classification with CNN**
   - Description: In this project, we explore the more powerful architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve image classification accuracy. We leverage Keras' Sequential API to build and train a CNN model.
